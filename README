whatmp3 is a small script to create mp3 torrents out of FLACs.

Depends on mktorrent, lame, and metalflac.

Configuration is handled at the top of the file in the configuration section.

Usage
-----
Running `whatmp3` on its own won't do too much. You need to specify the LAME flags you want to convert with, and the directories you want to convert.

You need to add your torrent passkey and output directory in order to make the `.torrent` file to upload to What.CD:

	$passkey = "YOUR PASSKEY HERE";

This will convert `OSI - Office of Strategic Influence` to V2 and V0:

	whatmp3 --V2 --V0 OSI\ -\ Office\ of\ Strategic\ Influence

This will convert `Porcupine Tree - Deadwing` and `Porcupine Tree - In Absentia` to 320 CBR, V0, and V2 (the "perfect three"):

	whatmp3 --320 --V2 --V0 Porcupine\ Tree\ -\ Deadwing Porcupine\ Tree\ -\ In\ Absentia

`.torrent` files will be created in your `output` directory.

`whatmp3` also supports a few command line flags as of 2.0, use `--verbose` or `-v` to print extra messages:

	whatmp3 --verbose --V2 Nightingale\ -\ I

Also supported are `--passkey`, `--tracker`, `--output`, `--notorrent`, `--zeropad`, and `--moveother`. These all do exactly what you think they would.
